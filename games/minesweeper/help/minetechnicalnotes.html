</p>

<p><a name="bugs"></a><font size="4"><b>Difficulties &amp; Known
Bugs:</b></font> </p>

<ul>
    <li>Pressing TAB will crash older versions of Netscape. I don't know why. Just don't do it.</li>
    <li>In Internet Explorer 5.0 through at least 6.0, the OnMouseOver event forces the window to take
        the focus from any other browser window.</li>
    <li>Opera 7.x ignores the no scroll bars directive, and the status line seen during loading causes the
        game window to have a left-right scroll bar. 
        The horizontal scroll bar causes a vertical scroll bar, which in turn makes
        the board wrap. On the plus side (sort of), Opera also ignores the 
        non-resizable directives, so the user can adjust the screen size accordingly.</li>
    <li>In Opera 7.x, the right mouse button doesn't work. The user must use
        the space bar instead.</li>
    <li>I'm sure there are more bugs. Tell me about yours, and
        I'll see what I can do.</li>
</ul>


<p><font size="4"><b>Differences from the Microsoft Version:</b></font> </p>

<ul>
    <li>To use the &quot;Area Open&quot; option click on
        an exposed square with the correct number of bomb
        neighbors marked. <font size="2">(much easier than left 
        and right clicking at the same time or double clicking).</font></li>
    <li>Did you know the MS version has an error with the clock?
        First of all, it jumps to 1 second immediately when you
        open the first square. Then it makes the first second tic
        based on the true clock, as opposed using the real-time
        original click as the baseline. In other words, you
        always have from 1 to 2 seconds added to your score! (<font
        size="2">Needless to say, my version doesn't do this.)</font></li>
    <li>The maximum number of bombs in a custom game is limited
        to 1/3 the total number of squares. <font size="2">(Any
        more than 1/3 bombs is unplayable anyway - but the real
        reason I did this has to do with the way I randomly place
        bombs in the program.)</font></li>
    <li>There is no way to pause or stop the clock. 
        <font size="2">(However, you can switch to counting clicks.)</font></li>
</ul>


<p><font size="4"><b>Enhancement in My Version:</b></font> </p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Opening Move option</b> - Not only will the first square never
        be a bomb, but neither will any of the neighbors. This
        goes a long way to leveling the playing field of random
        chance in the first few seconds, making Minesweeper more
        of a skill game. <font size="2">(It is statistically
        possible to
        have evenly spaced bombs and no 0-neighbor squares,
        although it is extremely unlikely, and not much fun to play.)</font></li>
    <li><b>Open Remaining option</b> - Many people play to find the bombs,
        as opposed to opening all the safe squares. This option allows those players
        to open all remaining squares all at once.
        <font size="2">(This feature won't apeal to the world record
        Minesweeper players, but makes the game more fun for the casual 
        players).</font></li>
    <li><b>Learning Mode</b> - I threw in this capability because I had the
        images anyway for my JavaScript Minesweeper Solver 
        <font size="2">(which I'm still working on.)</font></li>
    <li><b>Cheating</b> - Cheating games do not count towards high
        scores and cannot be submitted.</li>
    <li><b>Show Clicks</b> - Toggle between showing the time and the number
        of clicks made in the game.</li>
</ul>
