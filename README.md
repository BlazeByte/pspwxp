__Q. I get a message saying "The content connot be displayed"__

A. First make sure you typed in the address right (file:/pspWxp/index.htm). If the error still occurs, you may not have put the files in the right place. Follow step one to try again. If that also fails, it's probably a bug. Post it on the forums and I should be able to fix it._

A. The display mode must be set to normal. Change it by pressing triangle to bring up the toolbar and scroll to View and press X. Change the Display mode to Normal.

__Q. I do not here the welcome sound.__

A. You must have flash on your PSP. This is included with firmware version 2.7 (or later) and must be enabled through system settings. Please make sure Key Tones in settings are switched on, it's the only way to here sound from flash


__Q. The welcome sound seems garbled__

A. Wait for pspWxp to load, the loading screen will automatically disappear


__Q. I receive the error "Out of memory".__

A. The PSP has run out of memory and the internet browser must be refreshed
