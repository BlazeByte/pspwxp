What you should try:
--------------------
- The setup wizard demonstrates the new input text box and 
  saving settings

  files on the memory stick, only to input history)
- Settings Editor is the equivelent of regedit, and allows you 
  to view/edit the settings

  saved through Writer at the moment).
- Firefox shows how applications can save settings

Notes:
------
1. WARNING! Any saved files/settings will probably be cleared 
   when installing the final version of Encore - this is just 
   in case there are any errors in the Beta code, which there 
   are.

2. Only some features work when testing on a computer. I have 
   only tested in FireFox, and most features work, including 
   settings. This will be different for other browsers

3. Included with this zip is a PDF, which is documentation for
   creating applications. Please read this if you plan on 
   making applcations
