=Troubleshooter=

__Q. I get a message saying "The content connot be displayed"__

A. First make sure you typed in the address right (file:/pspWxp/index.htm). If the error still occurs, you may not have put the files in the right place. Follow step one to try again. If that also fails, it's probably a bug. Post it on the forums and I should be able to fix it._

__Q. I can't get to the desktop after the loading screen OR the text on the desktop and the start menu look squashed__

A. The display mode must be set to normal. Change it by pressing triangle to bring up the toolbar and scroll to View and press X. Change the Display mode to Normal.
