Instructions for adding your own Apps or Games:
1. Add your new files inside of the "user" folder.

2. If you are making new images...make a 20x20 px image
add it to the "user" folder located at
images/icons/menu/user/

3. Open up the "userlist.js" file with Notepad,
and follow/over-write the format of the examples
already there to add your additions.
You may also over-write the link I placed there to
this instructions.txt file if you wish.

4. Then...just go to the pspWxp Start Menu - 
User Additions tab or the User Additions List
in MY PSP to find and launch your
new additions.

5. Have fun!
